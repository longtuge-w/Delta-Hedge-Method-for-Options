## Files Overview

1. **Header Files (`*.h`)**: These files define the structure and prototypes of various functionalities.

   - `BSModel.h`: Contains functions related to the Black-Scholes model.
   - `DataRow.h`: Defines the structure and functions for data rows related to option contracts.
   - `utils.h`: Provides utility functions for searching and CSV export.
   - `test.h`: Contains the main logic and testing suite for the project.
2. **Implementation Files (`*.cpp`)**: These files provide the actual implementation of the functions.

   - `BSModel.cpp`: Black-Scholes model computations.
   - `DataRow.cpp`: Functions for managing data rows.
   - `utils.cpp`: Utility function implementations.
   - `main.cpp`: The main driver for the program.
3. **Python Visualization (`main.py`)**: A script to visualize the stock price paths and hedging errors using the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries.

## Setup and Requirements

1. **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).
2. **Python Environment**: Requires Python 3.x with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` installed.

## Implementation Guide

1. **Compilation**: Compile the C++ program using:

   ```bash
   g++ -o main BSModel.cpp DataRow.cpp utils.cpp main.cpp
   ```
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
3. **User Interaction**: The program will prompt you to select functionalities and provide necessary inputs. Follow the prompts to provide relevant parameters.
4. **Results**: After computation, the program will generate CSV files with results.

## Visualization

After obtaining CSV outputs, you can visualize the results:

1. Execute the Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The script will read CSV files and generate visualizations such as stock price paths and histograms of hedging errors.
